Tindahan, an all in one store management system with Cashiering, Inventory, and Statistics.

Made this for my CS26 (Software Development Fundamentals or Object Oriented Programming) course.
I could really have done a lot with the Statistics section like adding timeframes and graphs, but I was tired and there is only a few days left before the deadline.
Made using the java swing library. For the database, I used SQL.
Probably my biggest project at this time.
My GUI and frontend skills aren't that good since I prefer working on the backend, but I'm trying to improve my frontend skills.
Got a score of 95 for this project.

To run:
1. Use xampp.
2. Turn on Apache and MySQL
3. Use PHPMyAdmin and create a database named store_manager, and import the file in the "dbBackup" folder in the project.
4. Then run the project (I suggest you use intellij IDE).
